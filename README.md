# Hands-on Penetration Testing Labs 1.0

## This repository contains a practical series of penetration testing labs designed for cybersecurity learners, students preparing for certifications, or professionals seeking hands-on offensive security experience. These labs simulate real-world scenarios using virtual machines and Kali Linux in a safe, controlled environment.


# Requirements

## Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of Linux (terminal usage, file permissions, etc.)

Basic networking understanding (IP addresses, ports, protocols)

Kali Linux (latest version recommended)
